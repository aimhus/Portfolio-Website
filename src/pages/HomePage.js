            txt2p2="We created data generators that mimiced realistic rover movements and sensor data to develop our pathfinding algorithms. Having to manually account for all possible situations gave us a deeper understanding of what was needed and in turn helped us create more efficient pathfinding algorithms."

            txt3p1="The work I've done on this team has given me the opportunity to learn new languages, platforms and libraries. Some of my favourite takeaways have been Linux development, robust usage of Python libraries like pandas and Matplotlib, and more experience with communication protocols (UDP, TCP/IP, Ethernet)."
            txt3p2="My team and I have been working very hard towards creating the best algorithms we can to ensure success at the competition. I'm extremely excited to be leading these teams and can't wait to compete at CIRC 2021!"
